## How to run

1. Intall the dependencies - `npm i`
2. Run the server

```bash
npm run serve
```

3. CLI Login

Here you will test the full workflow with generation of aqua files

```bash
node login.mjs
```

This will generate `info_NUMBER.json` and `info_NUMBER.json.aqua.json` files which you can now import to `aquafier` or `cli` for testing
